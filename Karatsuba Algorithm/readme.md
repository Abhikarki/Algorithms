### The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most {\displaystyle n^{\log _{2}3}\approx n^{1.58}}{\displaystyle n^{\log _{2}3}\approx n^{1.58}} single-digit multiplications in general (and exactly {\displaystyle n^{\log _{2}3}}n^{\log _{2}3} when n is a power of 2). It is therefore asymptotically faster than the traditional algorithm, which requires {\displaystyle n^{2}}n^{2} single-digit products.
